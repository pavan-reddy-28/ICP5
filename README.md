1st question

This code first loads the glass dataset into a pandas dataframe and splits it into features (X) and target variables (y). The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. A Gaussian Naive Bayes model is then created, trained on the training data, and used to make predictions on the test data. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using the accuracy score and the classification report.

2nd question

In this code, we use the SVC class from scikit-learn's svm module to create a linear SVM model. The kernel parameter is set to "linear" to specify that we want to use a linear SVM. The model is then trained on the training data using the fit method and evaluated on the test data using the accuracy_score and classification_report functions from scikit-learn's metrics module.
